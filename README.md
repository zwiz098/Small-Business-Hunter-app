### Welcome to a new way to find Small Businesses 

### About this project

This app idea came to me when I first started my freelancing business. I wanted to work with a small startup business as my fist gig, knowing that there are so many small businesses out there without a website. But I soon realized that when hunting for small businesses, it was a struggle to find a business that had a clear way of contact, purchase, or even information about their business. After scrolling through countless Facebook groups and Instagram accounts, I decieded that there had to be a better way!

Small Business Hunter is that new way to find small businesses that you want to support!

### Project Features:

-Chat feature with business and user
-Rating
-Comment
-Bookmarking
-Search by filter

### Some things I struggled to accomplish with the project:

- Creating a search by filter: I had to implement some code that I was unfamilier with like "regex"
- syntax: As there where many features, it was hard to keep track of the type of syntax to use and for what
- chat feature: tried to implement socket io

Some things that I enjoyed about the project: 

- Seeing my ideas come to life!: It was awesome to see that I could code a site from scratch, and with my nown idea behind it! I loved working on this site and look forward to continue to make it even better!
